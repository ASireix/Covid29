Next-Gen Build Tool Framework
=============================

Currently grunt is the de-facto way of doing things on this project. However, grunt is quite outdated when compared to
gulp, brunch.io, and etc.

Point is if someone has a stick up their butt to do this we should migrate this project targeting angular 1.X before moving to or
supporting angular 2.X .


@nmccready is quite familiar with grunt, gulpjs, and brunch.io . But he feels that the project is not quite worth the effort in migrating yet.


Therefore if someone else who has experience in gulp, or brunch.io and has a fire in their belly to take this on for fun please raide your hand. :)
